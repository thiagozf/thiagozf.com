Hello! I’m Thiago ([thiagozf] on GitHub). I’m a developer who has spent years immersed
in tech—from building enterprise software solutions and embedded systems to tinkering
with generative AI models and Web3 smart contracts. Outside of work, I can be found
walking my dog, playing video games, or creating side projects to test out new ideas.

For quite a while, I’ve been searching for a platform to record my progress,
share insights, and collaborate with fellow developers. This blog is my answer
to that search. It’s a place to document real-world problems and to discuss
ideas I’m most curious about.

## Why Start a Blog?

### Sharing Knowledge

According to the [2024 Stack Overflow Developer Survey], around 82% of
respondents rely on community-generated resources (including personal dev
blogs) to learn how to code and expand their skills. This statistic highlights
the vital role that individual, firsthand experiences play in uplifting the
entire developer ecosystem.

Writing here is my way of contributing to that knowledge pool, paying forward
the help I’ve received from countless tutorials, GitHub repos, and blog posts
that helped me along my journey.

### Deepening My Understanding

Research from educational psychology consistently shows that teaching a concept
helps the teacher refine their own knowledge. When I break down a feature or
explain a concept in writing, I’m forced to untangle any confusions I might
have.

By turning my scattered notes into coherent posts, I can ensure my
understanding moves beyond surface-level familiarity.

### Building My Personal Brand

Many recruiters and potential collaborators (or investors?) look at a
developer’s online presence to gauge expertise and interests. A blog can
showcase not just “what” I build, but “how” I think.

It’s also a way to demonstrate communication skills, which are increasingly
vital — and often overlooked — in modern software development.

### Document the Journey

Over time, personal notes and random code snippets can get lost or forgotten.
Having a single, organized place for them means I can quickly track my progress
or revisit a tricky issue I solved in the past.

I’ve used tools like [Obsidian] in the past. However, putting these learnings
into a blog turns private notes into public resources — potentially helping
someone else facing the exact same issue.

## Why Now?

For so long, this blog was just an idea. Several factors kept it on the
backburner:

### Fear of Not Being “Good Enough”

Imposter syndrome is common in tech. Even though the industry relies on shared
experiences, many of us hesitate to contribute unless we feel like absolute
experts. In reality, even an “incomplete” tip or partial insight can be a
game-changer for someone else.

### Perfectionism

Perfectionism leads to procrastination. I’ve fallen into that cycle — delaying
this project because I wanted everything from design to site architecture to be
immaculate.

After reevaluating, I’ve accepted that “done” beats “perfect.” Iteration is
part of every successful project, including a blog.

### Time Constraints

My schedule can be chaotic. Between meeting deadlines, managing side projects,
writing regularly seemed unattainable. However, setting smaller, manageable
goals — such as writing short monthly updates — felt more feasible once I
acknowledged that I didn’t need to publish long articles every week.

### Overthinking the Audience

Worrying whether my content would be too niche or too general kept me
second-guessing whether to post at all. But the reality is, no matter how
specific the topic, there’s likely someone else out there grappling with the
same issue.

Engaging with even a handful of readers who genuinely value the content can be
motivating and worthwhile.

### Analysis Paralysis

The myriad options for blogging — static site generators (Astro, Hugo, Gatsby),
CMS platforms (WordPress, Ghost), or even building from scratch — can initially
slow you down. Ultimately, I realized the format matters less than creating and
sharing consistent, high-quality content. The perfect tech stack won’t matter
if there’s nothing to read.

## The Spark of Inspiration

The turning point arrived one late evening when I was neck-deep in debugging a
stubborn issue. I had searched through endless threads without much luck. Then
I stumbled upon a seemingly random comment on a GitHub issue — buried in a
conversation spanning dozens of replies — that pinpointed both the cause and
the fix for the exact scenario I was wrestling with. That one line of insight
saved me from hours more of frustration. In that moment, I truly grasped the
immense power of community-driven knowledge.

It wasn’t just about finding that one fix, though. As I took a step back, I
realized how much my entire journey had been catalyzed by others sharing what
they’d learned. From late-night Stack Overflow “Aha!” moments to reading through
tutorials that finally made a tough concept click, the generosity of strangers
had transformed my stumbling blocks into building blocks. At some point, I knew
it was time for me to contribute, not just consume.

## Final Thoughts

Launching this blog marks a significant milestone in my developer journey. It’s
a commitment not just to improve my own understanding, but also to actively
give back to a community that has guided me time and time again. If you’ve been
on the fence about starting your own blog, consider this a gentle push: your
experiences and lessons learned might be the exact breakthrough someone else
needs.

Thanks for joining me at the start of this new chapter. I’m excited to see how
this evolves, and I hope you’ll stick around for the ride. Whether you’re here
to learn, to share, or just to be part of the conversation, I’m grateful you’ve
stopped by!
